# Javascript Basics #

- Using the javascript console on Google Chrome
- Download the basic.html file
- Open javascrip console control+option+i
- Page source is control+option+u

- You can use the javascript console like a calculator 
- (Clearing the javascript console is control+l)
- You can also pull up what you last entered, using the UP button

- Like python, we can set integers to variable and treat them like integers
- Difference in javascript is we have to explicitly state that they are variables, or "var"

- Arrays can also be variables, like var Data = [1,2,3,4,5];

- We can use functions to modify our variables, and there are primarily two types of functions:
-- named funcitons // function myFunction(x) { return x * 2; } 
-- unnamed //  function(x) { return x * 2; }
